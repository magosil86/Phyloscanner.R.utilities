Individuals aged 15-49 years were surveyed from August 2011 to January 2015 in
40 communities of the Rakai Community Cohort Study (RCCS). 5,142 men and women
were found positive. Samples from 3,878 individuals were deep-sequenced (nearly
all individuals who did not report using antiretrovirals), and samples from
2,652 individuals were of sufficient quality for molecular epidemiological
analyses. We estimate that these samples correspond to approximately 47.0% of
eligible, infected and infectious individuals in the 40 RCCS communities.
